            <strong>Learn as many technical skills as I can:</strong>
            as part of the curriculum, we are learning C code, often used in electronics. 
            My goal is to be able to write C code perfectly.

            n7 Consulting a consulting club and Genius an entrepreneurial club. 
            I&#39;m hoping to extend my skill set beyond the realm of engineering by learning business skills.

            Become a well rounded engineer: 
            As I am not sure if I want to pursue engineering throughout my entire professional career, 
            I am trying to acquire as many skills as I can, allowing greater flexibility in the workforce. 
            I would like to do a double diploma in an American university, ideally in a something other than engineering

          International mobility 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <p class="text">
          As part of my studies, I am required to complete an international mobility in the country or countries of my choice. 
          I am hoping to do a semester abroad in an American university as it is my home country and growing up I always envisioned myself attending a prestigious American college. 
          Additionally, I plan to eventually return to the US to work, therefore attending university there would allow me to start building a professional network and bring me closer to my goal. 
          While I am keeping an open mind to other mobility opportunities, my heart is set on studying in my home country.
