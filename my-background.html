        <p class="intro">
          I grew up in San Diego, CA in a multicultural household&#8212; my mom is from Korea and my dad from France. 
          Therefore I am perfectly bilingual in French and English and speak elementary level Korean. 
          In 2019, my family decided to move to France where I have lived since. 
          I consider myself very lucky to have been exposed to many different cultures as I have developed a love of travel, 
          discovering and appreciating new cultures and meeting new people.

          I attended Pacific Trails Middle School, in San Diego CA where my love for science began: 
          I joined the Science Olympiad team to learn about astronomy and herpetology. 
          I also involved myself fully in extra-curriculars that the school had to offer, 
          I participated in band and joined the volleyball team. 
          I completed my freshman year of high school at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego where I pursued band 
          and decided to try various arts such as theater and intro to art.

          I am currently a student at ENSEEIHT, a french engineering school based in Toulouse.  
          After completing a two year program (classe préparatoire aux grandes ecoles) in Toulouse 
          I took the entrance exams for engineering school, commonly referred to as “Grandes ecoles” in France. 
          This program is very specific to the French education system and has no equivalent in English speaking countries. 
          I am now pursuing a masters degree in the field of electrical energy and electronics.
